It's called 101 Manatee Jokes.", "I know my fonts, and Papyrus is the worst font.", "You can't come back from the Land of Sam's Canned Ham Yams, man."], ["HEY, JERKWAD--Ooops, sorry! That was my cat.", "Do you want to have a man bun contest?", "Hey, do you have any birdwatching tips? I'm really into birdwatching lately."]],
        usefulDialogue: [["Welcome! You are entering a world of magic---well, magic that is made up of data, computer science and algorithms. I swear, it's a lot cooler than it sounds. I am Joe, the Dev Wizard, and this is Castle Full Stack. One day, perhaps you will possess all the knowledge held in these walls, but for now, let's focus on one thing: algorithms. Seek out the Wizard Assistants in the castle, and they will share their coding knowledge with you. Each Wiz will present you with a question. If you answer correctly, they will give you a salmon. Why a salmon, you ask? Because I used to be a marine biologist, and I find them soothing. When you have collected three salmon, return to me and test what you have learned--but, BE WARNED! If you return without sufficient salmon to complete my task, I shall not be amused. Good luck, and remember the most important thing: Always Be Coding.", "You're just in time for a reading from my book, 101 Manatee Jokes. What's a manatee's favorite drink? Bet you can't guess.", "EARL GREY MANA-TEA! Ah-HA, what a knee-slapper. Anyway, I had my doubts, but you have earned the right to 'Enscribe' your code upon the tablet below. But be warned! If you do not follow my directions, your answer will be wrong and you shall be doomed forevermore to wander the Land of the Lost Closing Parentheses. Now gaze upon the tablet, and follow my rules three: Do not wrap your function in curly brackets, do not write 'function', and whatever you do, DO NOT type '=>'. If you do, it will break, and I am just a sprite, so there is nothing I can do to help you. If your challenge is 'Write code to add two numbers together', your answer should be 'return a+b'.", "You did it! Snaps for you, and remember, Always Be Coding.", "Not quite. I'm muting the room so you can try again."], ["You again, huh? You know the drill. Don't talk to me till you have three salmon.", "How many times do I have to tell you? Go away!", "Wow, didn't expect you back here. Here's your algorithm. Remember, if the question is 'Write code to add two numbers together', your answer should be 'return a+b'. There's nothing I can do to help if you break it, so follow directions and you'll be fine.", "Nice work, man! Just think, three months ago you'd never even see an HTML tag, and just look at you now!", "I don't think you've always been coding."], ["Welcome back! If you get three salmon, maybe I'll show you a picture of my cat.", "Hey, just because we're cool now doesn't mean you can push it. Get three salmon first.", "Final question! Remember, don't break it. If the question is `Write code to add two numbers together', your answer should be 'return a+b'. I'm counting on you.", "Hey, nice job! As a prize for completing the final challenge, I present you with the ultimate gift: A joe.joe email address.", "You're good, but not good enough. Try again, man."]]

Maybe next time!"], ["You again! Here's your third question. I'm rooting for you!", "Great work, man! Keep it up!", "Nah, no salmon for you, dude.", "That was it. No more salmon.

It's a mystery."], ["Hey, don't tell anyone, but....*whispers* I like Papyrus.", "I'll do anything for a good Star Wars reference.", "This here's my partner Sam.

If you go see Denis next, make sure he's had his mac and cheese or you're not gonna like what happens.", "Ah, not quite. Gosh, now I'm gonna have to take Billie to the vet.", "I don't have any more salmon for ya, man."], ["Hey, welcome back! Listen to this: *insert killer drum solo here* Anyway...", "Right on, man! You're so close, just gotta get a few more salmon!", "Looks like it wasn't a salmon after all, just a bunch of nefarious fish.", "I already told you, Billie ate the salmon. Go see someone else."], ["Howdy, howdy! Back again, eh? Well, I'll surely stump ya this time!", "Boo-yah! Right again! You're on a roll, buddy!", "Oh, c'mon.
